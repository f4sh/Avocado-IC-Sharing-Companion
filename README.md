# Avocado IC Sharing Companion

I developed this simple but helpful tool to streamline my collaborative testing process within Star Citizen's Issue Council. The Avocado IC Sharing Companion is an extension for Firefox, Chrome, and Opera designed to make sharing insights from the Star Citizen Issue Council easier and more efficient. It's a humble tool, nothing groundbreaking, but I have found it incredibly helpful in my own testing endeavors.

For users of Firefox, the extension is available at the following link: [Avocado IC Sharing Companion on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/avocado-ic-sharing-companion/). You can also find it by searching directly within the Firefox Add-ons marketplace for a straightforward installation process. 

Those using Chrome can acquire the extension through this link: [Avocado IC Sharing Companion on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/avocado-ic-sharing-compan/lioooombpcigjchdhllgcblhbdbmmigp), or alternatively, directly from the Chrome Web Store. Users of Opera can install and utilize the extension by obtaining it directly from the Chrome Web Store, as it is supported.
